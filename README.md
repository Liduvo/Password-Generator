# Python Password Generator

## How can I run it?

You need any Python IDLE (like Pycharm, Visual Studio Code and Sublime Text) to run the code, or you can use an online development environment. It will be enough to copy the code and paste it where you will use it, and then run it.

This project aims to create passwords for the user by using different types of random or desired letters/numbers.
